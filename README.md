# Supermarket Sales Analysis using Power BI
In this project, I utilized Power BI to conduct a detailed analysis of supermarket sales data. The goal was to uncover insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the project:

# Data Import and Transformation
**Data Sources**: Imported sales data from multiple sources including CSV files and Excel sheets.

**Data Cleaning**: Transformed raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats using Power Query.

# Key Metrics and KPIs
**Sales Analysis**: Calculated total sales, average sales per transaction, and sales trends over time.

**Customer Insights**: Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior, identifying high-value and frequent customers.

**Product Performance**: Analyzed top-selling products, product categories, and inventory turnover rates.

# Data Visualization
**Interactive Dashboards**: Created interactive and visually appealing dashboards to display key metrics and trends.

**Charts and Graphs**: Used bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to visualize sales data and customer insights.

**Geographic Analysis**: Implemented map visuals to analyze sales performance by region.

# Insights and Recommendations
**Trend Identification**: Identified sales peaks and seasonal trends.

**Customer Behavior**: Provided insights into customer purchasing patterns and preferences.
